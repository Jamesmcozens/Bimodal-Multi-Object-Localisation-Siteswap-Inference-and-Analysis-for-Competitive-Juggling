# Bimodal-Multi-Object-Localisation-Siteswap-Inference-and-Analysis-for-Competitive-Juggling
The project objective is to provide a generalised real-time and non-real-time multi-object juggling tracker capable of accurately inferring siteswap sequences, beat positions, various tracked component spatial derivatives, and performance evaluation metrics for a variety of conditions

This repository will host the code for ``Bimodal Multi-Object Localisation, Siteswap Inference, and Analysis for Competitive Juggling". The code is currently being finalised and will be made available here within the next month. Please check back later for updates. Thank you for your interest in our work.
