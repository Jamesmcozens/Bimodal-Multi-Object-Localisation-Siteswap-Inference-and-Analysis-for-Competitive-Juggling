# Bimodal-Multi-Object-Localisation-Siteswap-Inference-and-Analysis-for-Competitive-Juggling
The project objective is to provide a generalised real-time and non-real-time multi-object juggling tracker capable of accurately inferring siteswap sequences, beat positions, various tracked component spatial derivatives, and performance evaluation metrics for a variety of conditions. This repository will host the code for ``Bimodal Multi-Object Localisation, Siteswap Inference, and Analysis for Competitive Juggling". 

Paper link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706333

The code is currently being finalised and will be made available here soon. Please check back later for updates. Thank you for your interest in our work.
